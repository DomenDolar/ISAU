Internet Services used by Artificial Users

The idea of this project is to create prototype that will show that it is possible to create artificial users that behave like humans using different internet services.

The idea of this project is to create programs that will create artificial users and this users will use different internet services. All programs must be open source and they must run on free cloud services.

Creating artificial users and using internet services will use AI.

1. Artificial user - AU
   - must independently create data for user (name, second name, buirth date, sex, ...) Each user must have it own picture and this picture must be generated - should not exists like https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/.
   - the user should have a “heartbeat” through which the user can learn and control
   
   Creating user should be a AI process. (maybe using phyton, macro recorder, ...)
   
2. Internet service (service on internet which user can use)
    - sign up, log in and log out from the servce 
    - using the service 
    
  Each step should be programmable with usage of AI if needed.
    
    
All programs shoud run on Free Cloud infrastructure. All probramsmust be open sourced.

Sample:

Free Cloud Infrastructure
  - Running program for creating Artificial  User 
    - AU create mail account (GMail, Outlook, ...). Programs for sign up, log in, log out, sending mail and reading mail.
    - AU create one social account (Facebook, Instagrem, Snapchat, ... ) Programs for sign up, log in , log out and making a post.
    - AU create account on free cloud services (AWS, Oracle Cloud, Google Cloud, ...) Programs for sign up, log in log out and creating VM for AU.
